## Introduction

*The purpose of this shiny app is to add interactivity to the simple line graphs of US Personal Expenditures from the {datasets} package. By adding interactivity to these plots, the user will be more engaged with the data product, which will facilitate the desired knowledge transfer.*

## Conclusion

*After viewing the shiny app, one can easily see how interacting with a dynamic data product is much more engaging than viewing a static data product. As a result of the increased level of engagement from interactive data products, the data product user should be able to absorb the desired information more easily.*
